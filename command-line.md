The command line is a place you can talk to your computer with text instead of a mouse. 
it's kind of like the actual computer without all the pretty looking stuff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. ls 
 
 
ls (list files) shows you a list of all the files that are in the selected folder. 
 
 
2. cd. 
 
 
cd (change directory) is a command that lets you navigate to different folders in the computer. 
 
 
3. mkdir. 
 
 
this command is used to create a new folder in whatever folder you currently have selected. 
 
 
4. rm. 
 
rm (remove) is used to remove a file from a folder OR remove a folder from your computer! 
 
 
5. open. 
 
 
open is a command that you may have guessed is used to open a file. it can also be used to open a file in a specific program (pretty neat). 
 
6. touch. 
 
touch is used to create an empty file. 
 
 
7. mv. 
 
mv (move) is used to rename a file or folder. it is called move because you are technically not renaming the file, you are just moving it to a different address. 
 
 
8. pwd. 
 
pwd (print working directory) will show you where the directory (folder) you currently have selected is located. 
 
 
9. cp. 
 
cp (copy) is yet another self-explanatory command. cp will make a copy of a file. 
 
 
10. date. 
 
the date command shows you the current time and date. it's really useful if you are like me and are so busy working on assessments you don't even have time to look at the top of the screen.
